# QUANTHACKATHON25

This project is designed to analyze **market regimes, predict market states (Bull, Bear, Static), and implement a Kelly Criterion-based trading strategy**. The project is divided into **three questions**, each addressing a different aspect of market analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Market Regime Visualization** (Question 1)
- **Machine Learning for Market Prediction** (Question 2) 
- **Market-Regime + Indicators Trading Strategy** (Question 3) 
- **Portfolio Performance Analysis** (Win Rate, Sharpe Ratio, Drawdowns)
